<span>Eclipse Foundation Introduces Open Collaboration Tools (OCT) to Transform Remote Development</span>

<span><span>Jacob Harris</span></span>

<span>Thu, 2024-12-05 06:45
</span>

            <p dir="ltr"><strong>BRUSSELS – 5 December 2024 –&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.eclipse.org" rel="nofollow">The Eclipse Foundation</a>, one of the world’s largest open source software foundations, today announced the creation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.open-collab.tools/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse Open Collaboration Tools (OCT)&nbsp;</a>project. This project falls under the purview of the&nbsp;<a href="https://ecdtools.eclipse.org/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse Cloud DevTools Working Group</a>, marking an exciting step forward in advancing cloud-based development tools. Contributed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.typefox.io/" rel="nofollow">TypeFox</a>, a leader in open source tool development, this innovative project enables real-time collaboration for remote developer teams by building on the robust capabilities of the innovative cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE)&nbsp;<a href="https://theia-ide.org/" rel="nofollow">Eclipse Theia</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Transforming Remote Collaboration</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Eclipse OCT project addresses the growing demand for seamless remote work solutions, redefining how developers collaborate within IDEs and domain-specific tools. This suite of open source libraries and tools enables teams to collaborate in real-time from anywhere in the world. With OCT, teams can launch sessions to live-share workspaces, highlight text, and display cursor positions.&nbsp;</p>
<p dir="ltr">“The Eclipse OCT project represents the cutting edge in productivity solutions for remote developer teams,” said Mike Milinkovich, the executive director of the Eclipse Foundation. “By seamlessly integrating with tools like Theia IDE, it offers a flexible and extensible collaboration platform that empowers developers to seamlessly collaborate from anywhere.”&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Built on a Solid Foundation: Eclipse Theia IDE</h3>
<p dir="ltr">The Eclipse OCT project extends the&nbsp;<a href="https://theia-ide.org/#theiaide" rel="nofollow">Eclipse Theia IDE</a> with live-sharing capabilities. Designed to meet the evolving demands of modern developers, Theia is built on&nbsp; the latest web technologies for cloud and desktop usage, including advanced standards such as the&nbsp;<strong>Language Server Protocol (LSP)</strong> and the&nbsp;<strong>Debug Adapter Protocol (DAP)</strong>. Its use of the&nbsp;<strong>Monaco Code Editor</strong> ensures a cutting-edge coding environment. Theia’s compatibility with&nbsp;<strong>VS Code extensions</strong>, accessible via the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1F5OWJOqEw0ce9TbCfoyCx-LzkVixgBChliDDzk6l0iE/edit" rel="nofollow"><strong>Open VSX registry</strong></a>, combined with its modular architecture, makes it highly customisable and adaptable to a wide range of development workflows and preferences. This flexibility is further enhanced by live sharing, now available with OCT, enabling seamless collaboration.</p>
<h3>A Commitment to Openness</h3>

<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Transparent Development</strong>: Fully open server, client, and protocol implementations.</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Vendor-Neutral Governance</strong>: Managed by the Eclipse Foundation for equitable collaboration.</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Self-Hosting Option</strong>: Organisations can host their own servers for data privacy and security.</li>
</ul>
<h3 dir="ltr">Tailored for Extensibility</h3>
<p dir="ltr">Eclipse OCT is extensible and fully customisable for a superior collaboration experience. Some significant features include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Customisable Server:</strong> Tailor server functionality to specific organisational needs.</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>IDE&nbsp; Integrations:&nbsp;</strong>Adaptable for use with any IDE for custom workflows</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Web App Support:&nbsp;</strong>Integrate custom web apps for a seamless cross-platform experience.</li>
<li dir="ltr"><strong>Adaptable Editing Modes:&nbsp;</strong>Support editing paradigms like graphical editors, forms, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Current integrations include:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">Out-of-the-box support for Theia IDE</li>
<li dir="ltr">A VS Code Extension, available on Open VSX and the VS Code Marketplace</li>
<li dir="ltr">An extension for Theia to be used in custom tools and IDEs</li>
<li dir="ltr">Server application for session authentication, with a public instance at api.open-collab.tools</li>
<li dir="ltr">TypeScript libraries for integrating with different environments</li>
<li dir="ltr">Built-in end-to-end encryption and extensible user authentication</li>
